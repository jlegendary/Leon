# Leon
Named after Leon Battista Alberti (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Battista_Alberti) this is an artificial Intelligence to decipher encrypted messages and codes.

*current Development stage: * conceptualization / proof of concept

## Introduction

The main goal of this project is to use the benefits of artificial intelligence in the fields of cryptography. Algorithms commonly used to develop AI systems will test and try to decipher encrypted messages.

We intent to use a web interface to send encrypted messages to the AI, which will deduce the contents and reply the clear text message.


## why the name Leon?

I decided to name it after Leon Battista Alberti since he was a cryptographer. He was the inventor of polyalphabetic substitution (more specifically, the Alberti cipher), and what may have been the first mechanical encryption aid.



## How will this be developed?


The main artificial intelligence body should be constructed with Java. Using algorithms like natural selection and swarm intelligence to solve messages and verify their meaning.
The database will be mongoDB (noSQL). 
The web interface will be developed using TomCat server, with a simple minimalistic layout.
